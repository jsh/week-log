# Jeff Learns Generating Functions

I'm going to try to learn how to work with generating functions,
and [blog about it](https://jsh.github.io/learn-generating-functions/) as I go.

I'm interested in trends, and I have [a Python project to explore them](https://github.com/jsh/trendlist).
Some statistical facts about trends are combinatorial, and can be understood with statistics of random permutations.
Pure-combinatorial arguments give me some results, but many things I find on the internet deduce the same results with generating functions.
