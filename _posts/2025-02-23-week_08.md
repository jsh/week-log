* Set up a weblog for weekly entries.

    - Thrash a little, unsuccessfully, doing it from scratch.
    - Make the learn-generating-functions blog a template,
    then clone and customize it.
    - Add keys to ChromebookPlus .ssh/ to permit posting from it.
* First read of Mosteller and Rourke
    on confidence intervals for medians, and their ilk.
* Explore using GitHub copilot to decompose lists into streaks and kv_streaks

    Keys for kv_streaks are first elements of the streaks, values are the lengths of the streak starting with that element.)

    - generate random ndarrays of range(n)
    - generate all permutations of range(n)
    - decompose each of these into streaks and kv_streaks
