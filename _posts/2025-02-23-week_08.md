* Set up a weblog for weekly entries.

    - Thrash a little, unsuccessfully, doing it from scratch.
    - Make the learn-generating-functions blog a template,
    then clone and customize it.
    - Add keys to ChromebookPlus .ssh/ to permit posting from it.
    - First read of Mosteller and Rourke
        on confidence intervals for medians, and their ilk.
