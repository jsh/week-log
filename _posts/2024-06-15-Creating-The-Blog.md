First step: Actually creating the blog.

I'm making the blog on GitHub pages because it's a natural place to put it.

I already know some Git, so I'm comfy with that aspect,
and this gives me a chance to find out more about what GitHub offers.

I went through GitHub's tutorial, to create [a little, test blog](https://jsh.github.io/skills-github-pages),
then went back and repeated the process, with tweaks, to create [this blog](https://jsh.github.io/learn-generating-functions).
These meant trying out GitHub pages _and_ GitHub actions, struggling through all the expected mistakes, and even playing with jeckyll themes.

I think the blog is working now, so I'll delete my earlier test posts, commit this one, debug it, and finally merge into master.
