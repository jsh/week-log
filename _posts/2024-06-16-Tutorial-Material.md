When I looked for tutorial material on generating functions, I found plenty.

There's universal consensus that the best book is Herbert Wilf's _generatingfunctionology_. [The second edition is free, on-line](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/DownldGF.html), but I wanted something I could touch. I bought a [hardback, third edition](https://www.amazon.com/generatingfunctionology-Third-Herbert-S-Wilf/dp/1568812795/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.W5lxPqUwhyp0LFS6zQhMQzIZ7oEUoT6rzGe5Ne0386RuO35dCiNFLh-2mIIs5uoKuHlTi44XIknHqCRLkhhuWw.rEr7Bze20Fj45Ksg6pSnE_NFmYMtKXhxMQL7EDAl2vU&dib_tag=se&keywords=generating+functionology&qid=1718573404&sr=8-1), which appeared on my doorstep 19 hours after I ordered it from Amazon.

I read recently that the FAA is giving approval for drone deliveries from Amazon, and Melody Childs tells me that she's already had one drone delivery from them. Perhaps my next book from them will arrive even faster.

There are, of course, plenty of YouTube videos and other on-line materials, too, each of which has plusses and minuses. One I like is [_An Introduction to Ordinary Generating Functions_](https://garsia.math.yorku.ca/~zabrocki/MMM1/MMM1Intro2OGFs.pdf), by Mike Zabrocki. It's a fifty-two page, on-line book including exercises. Not too deep or detailed, it feels like it's presenting the material at a resonable pace for me.
