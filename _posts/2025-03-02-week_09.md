* Math
    - Expand streaks2
        - Prove # of streaks, length j, that start with k = number of streaks, length k, that start with j
        - Add routines to streaks2 to illustrate the equality
        - Number of cycles that start with k = number of cycles of length k = N!/k (from the permutation block)
        - Number of cycles that start with 1 = N!/1 = N!
        - Number of cycles that start with N = N!/N = (N-1)!
